### * UNCERTAINTY
## Used in AI to make inferences with incomplete information by using probaability.

## * PROBABILITY THEORY
# A branch of mathematics that deals with calculating the likelihood of events.
'''
    States that for a given event, there are many possible worlds (w), where each world has a probability (P(w)).
        - Every probability is between 0 and 1:     0 ≤ P(w) ≤ 1 (inclusive)
            1 - Certain
            0 - Impossible
        - The sum of all probabilities is 1:        ∑ P(w) = 1

        For a pair of events A and B:
            - each event may or may not have the same probability with other events
            - however, the sum of the probabilities will never be the same with other pairs of events

    UNCONDITIONAL PROBABILITY
    the degree of belief in a proposition (P(A)) without any other information
    calculates the probability of an event A by dividing the number of ways event A can occur by the total number of possible events


    CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY
    the degree of belief in a proposition (P(A|B)) given some other information (B) that is known
        - P(A|B) is read as "the probability of A given B"

        formula:
            P(A|B) = P(A ^ B) / P(B)
    
    RANDOM VARIABLE
    a variable in probability theory with a domain of possible values it can take on
