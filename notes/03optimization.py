### * OPTIMIZATION
## Choosing the best option from a set of options

## * LOCAL SEARCH
# a search algorithm that only maintains a single node and searches by moving to a neighboring node
'''
    it does not simultaneously explore multiple paths

    useful for problems where only the solution matters 
'''

## * STATE SPACE LANDSCAPE
# a visualization (diagram) of the cost (in vertical bars) of each state in a search problem
'''
    calculated by a heuristic function
    
    can be used to determine the global maximum/minimum of an objective/cost function
'''

##! Strategy for Local Search
# * take a state, maintaining some current node, and move in a state-space landscape to find a global maximum/minimum
