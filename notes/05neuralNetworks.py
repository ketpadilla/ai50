# a mathematical model for learning inspired by biological neural networks
'''
  models a mathematical function mappping inputs to outputss based on the network's structure and parameters

  ACTIVATION FUNCTION
  function calculating a node's output (refer to learning algorithms)
    e.g., 
      1. Step Function
        g(x) = 1 if x ≥ 0, else 0

      2. Logistic Sigmoid
        g(x) = e^x / (e^x + 1)

      3. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
        g(x) = max(0, x)
      
  used -> hw(x) = g(w • x)
